# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio
The purpose of this repository is to showcase all the work I have completed over the AI course.

#### GOALS
- Learn Github Basics.
- Be familiar with reading languages like python.
- Understand basic programming concepts.



I have split the lab work into 7 different notebooks (including the machine learning python notebook) due to the size of some files.
