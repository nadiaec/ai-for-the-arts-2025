    "    2. Variable Creation:\n",
    "        message = \"Hello, world!\": Here, we create a variable named message and assign it the value \"Hello, world!\". A variable is like a container that holds data. In this case, the data is the string \"Hello, world!\".\n",

    "        print(message): The print function is used to display the value of the variable message on the screen. When the program runs, it will output Hello, world!.\n",

    "    1. Variables: Variables store data that can be used and manipulated throughout the program. They make the code more flexible and easier to understand.\n",
    "    2. Assignment: The = sign is used to assign a value to a variable. In this example, the string \"Hello, world!\" is assigned to the variable message.\n",
